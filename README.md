Tic Tac Toe
===========

Half of [Hacker School](http://http://www.hackerschool.com/) seems to have written a
Tic-Tac-Toe implementation. This is my contribution and my first program in
[Julia](http://julialang.org/).

Run the game by entering `julia tick_tac_toe.jl` at the command line.

The game can be played with a combination of human and computer controled players.
Human players enter commands of the form "A1" where A is the column and 1 is the row.
"END" aborts the game.
