Tic Tac Toe
===========

Half of [Hacker School](http://http://www.hackerschool.com/) seems to have done a
Tic Tac Toe implementation. This is my first attempt.

Currently there is no AI. Two human players take turns to enter commands of the
form "A1" where A is the column and 1 is the row. "END" aborts the game.

Run this by entering the Julia REPL and entering <code>require("tic_tac_toe.jl")</code>
followed by <code>main()</code>.
